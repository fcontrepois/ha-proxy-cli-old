[--address--]:--port-- [, ...]
[--address--]:--port-- [, ...] interface --interface--
  Define one or several listening addresses and/or ports in a frontend.
  May be used in sections :   defaults | frontend | listen | backend
                                  no   |    yes   |   yes  |   no
  Arguments :
    <address>     is optional and can be a host name, an IPv4 address, an IPv6
                  address, or '*'. It designates the address the frontend will
                  listen on. If unset, all IPv4 addresses of the system will be
                  listened on. The same will apply for '*' or the system's
                  special address "0.0.0.0".

    <port>        is the TCP port number the proxy will listen on. The port is
                  mandatory. Note that in the case of an IPv6 address, the port
                  is always the number after the last colon (':').

    <interface>   is an optional physical interface name. This is currently
                  only supported on Linux. The interface must be a physical
                  interface, not an aliased interface. When specified, all
                  addresses on the same line will only be accepted if the
                  incoming packet physically come through the designated
                  interface. It is also possible to bind multiple frontends to
                  the same address if they are bound to different interfaces.
                  Note that binding to a physical interface requires root
                  privileges.

  It is possible to specify a list of address:port combinations delimited by
  commas. The frontend will then listen on all of these addresses. There is no
  fixed limit to the number of addresses and ports which can be listened on in
  a frontend, as well as there is no limit to the number of "bind" statements
  in a frontend.

  Example :
            *:80,*:443
            :80,:443
            10.0.0.1:10080,10.0.0.1:10443
